# Restaurant API

This project follows a [hexagonal architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749) to uncouple the responsibilities from the business logic and the frameworks/libraries.

## Deploy

```bash
# I would like to change the image creation to a multistage docker in order to reduce the image size as much as
# possible. But since I'm not that versed on scala I decided to use an automatic packager.
$ sbt docker:publishLocal
# To deploy it on k8s (prepared for the k8s docker-desktop)
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s.yml
# To use it in plain docker
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 restaurant-api:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

## Client

We are using `k6` as a client. Grafana k6 is an open-source load testing tool where we can set multiple sync/async clients.

### Install

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
# You may need to create the /out folder
$ mkdir out
```

### Run

```bash
$ npm start
```

## FAQ

**Why K8S and not AWS lambdas?**

**P 1**: When using Serverless platforms the first invocation of a function takes
some time since the code needs to be initialized. In this case we will need a fast
response since this service will be integrated with a stack of MS.

**P 2**: Kubernetes might provide better scalability features than some Serverless
platforms, since Kubernetes is more mature and provides even HA (high availability)
between different zones which not all Serverless platforms provide yet.

**P 3**: it might be easier to use Kubernetes for more complex applications because
the platform is more mature. And since we are planning to use a database to
store the outcome of the logic, that make sense.

**P 4**: Serverless doesnâ€™t automatically mean lower costs, like when your
applications need to run 24/7. There can also be some hidden costs like extra
costs for API management or the costs for the function invocations for tests.

**P 5**: The monitoring capabilities of Kubernetes applications are much more
mature.
